- neurodata_type_def: DynamicTable
  neurodata_type_inc: NWBDataInterface
  doc: A group containing multiple datasets that are aligned on the first dimension
    (Currently, this requirement if left up to APIs to check and enforce). Apart from
    a column that contains unique identifiers for each row there are no other required
    datasets. Users are free to add any number of VectorData objects here. Table
    functionality is already supported through compound types, which is analogous
    to storing an array-of-structs. DynamicTable can be thought of as a struct-of-arrays.
    This provides an alternative structure to choose from when optimizing storage
    for anticipated access patterns. Additionally, this type provides a way of creating
    a table without having to define a compound type up front. Although this convenience
    may be attractive, users should think carefully about how data will be accessed.
    DynamicTable is more appropriate for column-centric access, whereas a dataset
    with a compound type would be more appropriate for row-centric access. Finally,
    data size should also be taken into account. For small tables, performance loss
    may be an acceptable trade-off for the flexibility of a DynamicTable. For example,
    DynamicTable was originally developed for storing trial data and spike unit metadata.
    Both of these use cases are expected to produce relatively small tables, so the
    spatial locality of multiple datasets present in a DynamicTable is not expected
    to have a significant performance impact. Additionally, requirements of trial
    and unit metadata tables are sufficiently diverse that performance implications
    can be overlooked in favor of usability.
