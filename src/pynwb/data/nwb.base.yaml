    doc: Data values. Data can be in 1-D, 2-D, 3-D, or 4-D. The first dimension

      doc: Base unit of measurement for working with the data. This should be
        the SI unit, where appropriate, such as volts. If the data are stored
        in non-standard units, the attribute ''conversion'' describes how to convert the
        data to the specified SI unit. e.g. if the data are stored as int32 values,
        where a difference of 1 corresponds to a difference of 4.5 * 10^-6 V, then store the
        original int32 values here, set ''conversion'' to 4.5 * 10^-6, and to access the
        data in volts, multiply ''data'' by ''conversion''.
